  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

  <p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
    on my website, and it's about the 5th one I've built myself!
  </p>

  <p>
    This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
    back and see how my journey is going!
  </p>

  <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
    <li>
      I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.
    </li>
    {
      identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
        <li>
          Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and
          {identity.hobbies[1]}
        </li>
      )
    }
  </ul>

  <p>My skills are:</p>
  <ul>{skills.map((s) => <li class='skill'>{s}</li>)}</ul>

  {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

  {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

  {
    goal === 3 ? (
      <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p>
    ) : (
      <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>
    )
  }
</Base>
